# Splitgate Config Files

This repository contains configuration files for Splitgate to enhance your gaming experience.

## Installation Instructions

1. Navigate to your Splitgate installation folder:
   ```
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Splitgate\PortalWars
   ```
   Note: Your installation path may vary.

2. Create a new folder named `config` in the `PortalWars` directory.

3. Add the following files to the `config` folder:
   - `userinput.ini`
   - `userengine.ini`

4. (Optional) If you want to use the experimental configuration:
   - Rename the experimental file to `userengine.ini` before adding it to the `config` folder.

## Files Included

- `userinput.ini`: Contains user input configurations
- `userengine.ini`: Contains engine-related settings
- `experimental_userengine.ini`: Experimental settings (rename to `userengine.ini` to use)
- `userengine_insanity+++`: VERY Experimental & WEIRD settings (rename to `userengine.ini` to use)
- `userengine_releasecandidate`: Potentially to be the recommended but needs more testers this is generally 'safe'
- `userengine_minimal`: No forced multithreading or async just lower graphics and minimal settings for performance. 

## Usage

After installing the configuration files, launch Splitgate. The game should automatically detect and apply the new settings.
